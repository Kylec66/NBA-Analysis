2016-2017, 2017-2018 (Kyle Carlson)

How were the ages broken down per team in 2016-17?
The ages for the 2016-17 finals teams were Cleveland with a 25.5 avg with golden state having an older team with a 28 avg. With Cleveland’s guards being 2 years older and their forwards and centers being 2.5 years younger.  Golden state won and there showed to be little correlation between age being a deciding factor and more of a play style mismatch.

How did each team break down their salary in 2016-17?
In 2016 golden state had a salary distribution much different from Cleveland in their team building where they prioritized forwards in 2016 making up 55% of their roster while centers only made up 8%. Cleveland spent 18% on their center position demonstrating a difference in play style and it is reflected in their salary breakdown.

How were the ages broken down per team in 2017-18?
The ages for the 2017-18 finals teams were Cleveland added some veteran players at the forward position and the center position with the avg for both going up 5 years from the year prior. Golden state had an influx of younger players with their avg dropping at the guard and forward spot by 2 years. Golden state won and there showed to be little correlation between age being a deciding factor and more of a play style mismatch.

How did each team break down their salary in 2017-18?
In 2017 golden state stuck to their same strategy from the year prior and doubled down on paying forwards and guards making up 88% of their roster and centers getting even fewer total percent of the salary cap. Cleveland also did a similar strategy from the year prior and brought in more expensive, experienced, centers into the roster to overcome their deficiencies from the year prior. They paid their centers 30% of their cap total to maintain their playstyle and still failed to achieve their NBA championship.

For the 2018-19 Finals (Tyler Christian)

How are the payrolls distributed?
In regard to payroll distribution, it was not surprising to see how much money was given to guards, given the dependence on small-ball players in the modern NBA. It was very interesting to learn how Toronto wisely spent their money for all three main position groups, while the Warriors placed extremely little emphasis on centers. Both payroll distribution and roster construction are highly subjective to all NBA team front offices, but it was nice to see the comparison between one team focused on small ball and the other taking a more even position approach.

What are the variations in ages per each player position?
Through the age grouping by position, guards were the most common in terms of having similar ages, which was in the late 20s. However, like the payrolls section, there were big differences between forwards and centers. The Warriors’ forwards were slightly younger than the guards, but Toronto had a collective group that was several years younger in terms of mean age. Lastly, the center position age group featured the most gaping difference between the two teams. Toronto’s group was the oldest out of all mean age amounts in all of the combined datasets. However it proved big in that the high amount invested in the position was key to creating more variety in their schemes than that of the Warriors.

Why did the Raptors win?
The Raptors won because they played a more strategic approach to roster construction, rather than the Warriors relying on the relatively the same type for several years. For the two previous finals, the Warriors roster was highly reliant on two position groups and almost completely ignored the other. They were also slowly increasing in mean age at both. Toronto on the other hand, prioritized creating a “complete team” that had diverse payroll distribution to all three positions, while also being cost-effective to a core of young forwards, and landing established veterans at center that brought more experience and range to a loaded offense that could score and defend in way more ways than the Warriors could with their group.
